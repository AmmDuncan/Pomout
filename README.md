# Pomout

Pomodoro timer app to help you divide work into short sprints and avoid burning out. ðŸ˜ª

## Technologies Used
- **React**
- **Redux & Redux Toolkit** (State Management)
- **Styled-Components v5** (Styling and Theming)

## Features
- LocalStorage as persistent storage
- App level configuration
- Project level configuration

## Room For Future Improvement
- connect to an online database to allow access to the personalized data on multiple devices.
- add user authentication to secure each userâ€™s data.
- add a feature to check on friendsâ€™ progress.

## Issues
- The timer complete sound may not work as expected on mobile, when the browser is not in view. (*It does work fine when you are in another tab*)
